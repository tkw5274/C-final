With all of the various programs and applications consumers can use to not only look up services for various companies, but also schedule service appointments, there have been numerous complaints about the difficulty to use them. I have developed a program that is not only user-friendly but also universal to any type of company who utilizes it. In addition to making easier access for consumers, companies will also save money over time with less technical issues and complaints. 
This program is going to personally greet you by name when you first open it and inform you of the business that you are scheduling with. Then it will ask you what type of computer services you need by giving you options to pick, using numbers for you to select. Once you pick which service you want, it will calculate the total and include the sales tax. Then the program will allow the user to set up an appointment for the services previously selected. The program will store the information inputted by the user securely for the technician in this case to review and use.
	This program will be beneficial to companies who utilize on-call and call-out services. The program will be user friendly, easy customizable and less likely to have technical errors versus competitors. It will be efficient and cost effective for business and less time consuming for the consumer.
